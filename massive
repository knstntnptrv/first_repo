3.3.1        Keywords
 The alphabetic characters listed below are used as keywords.
 A numeric value after each keyword has the following meaning:

      Keyword                                Meaning of a numeric value that follows
         N          Parameter number
         Q          Data identifier (1: Parameter data, 0: Pitch error compensation data)
         Ｔ          Machine group number (1) of a machine group type parameter
         Ｌ          Path number (1 to number of controlled paths) of a path type parameter
         A          Controlled axis number (1 to number of controlled axes) of an axis type parameter
         S          Spindle number (1 to number of controlled spindles) of a spindle type parameter

3.3.2              Inch/Metric Switching
   For parameters dependent on inch/metric switching such as those for length and feedrate, whether data is
   inch data or metric data is specified by the input mode in the case of input from the MDI panel, or by the
   keyword I or M prefixed to the data in the case of input from an external I/O device. The keyword I or M
   is added also when data is output from an external I/O device.
   If the input mode or keyword differs from the actually used mode as in a case where data input in the inch
   mode is used in the metric mode, the CNC performs automatic data conversion. So, data need not be
   converted according to a mode change. Moreover, when parameter data is displayed, the data is converted
   according to the display mode. However, when data is output from an external I/O device, the original
   data is output according to the original keyword.


3.3.3              Bit Format
    N            *****             Q1                  P         ********                           ;

   A numeric value after N represents a parameter number.
   Q1 indicates that the data is parameter data.
   An 8-digit binary number after P represents the bit values (0/1) of a parameter, with the first digit
   corresponding to bit 0 and the eighth digit corresponding to bit 7.
   Leading zeros may not be omitted.
   A semicolon (;) marks the end of a block. (LF is used for the ISO code, and CR is used for the EIA code.)

     Example
       N00010Q1P00000001;
       Parameter No.         10
       Parameter value
         Bit 0 is set to 1, and the other bits are set to 0.

3.3.4              Bit Machine Group Format
    N          *****          Q1                T1           P          ********                        ;

   A numeric value after N represents a parameter number.
   Q1 indicates that the data is parameter data.
   T1 indicates the 1st machine group (for the 0i-D/0i Mate-D, the 1st machine group is always assumed).
   The 8-digit binary number that follows P includes the bit values (0 or 1) of the parameter in the 1st
   machine group; the first bit corresponds to bit 0 and the eighth bit to bit 7.
   Leading zeros may not be omitted.
   A semicolon (;) marks the end of a block. (LF is used for the ISO code, and CR is used for the EIA code.)

    NOTE
    1 Each of the parameters of the bit, bit machine group, bit path, bit axis, and bit
      spindle types consists of 8 bits for one data number (parameters with eight
      different meanings).
    2 For machine group types, the parameters corresponding to the maximum
      number of machine groups are present, so that independent data can be set for
      each machine group. For the 0i -D/0i Mate-D, the maximum number of
      machine groups is always 1.
    3 For path types, parameters corresponding to the maximum number of paths are
      present, so that independent data can be set for each path.
    4 For axis types, parameters corresponding to the maximum number of control
      axes are present, so that independent data can be set for each control axis.
    5 For spindle types, parameters corresponding to the maximum number of
      spindles are present, so that independent data can be set for each spindle axis.
    6 The valid data range for each data type indicates a general range. The range
      varies according to the parameters. For the valid data range of a specific
      parameter, see the explanation of the parameter.

       OF PARAMETERS". Basically, set these parameters to 0.
     2 Parameters that are valid only for either the lathe system (T series) or the
       machining center system (M series) are indicated in two rows as shown in the
       following examples. When a row is blank, the parameter is not usable with the
       corresponding series. Basically, set these parameters to 0.

         [Example 1]
            Parameter HTG is a parameter common to the M and T series, but
            Parameters RTV and ROC are parameters valid only for the T series.

         [Example 2]
            The following parameter is provided only for the M series.
                                                                                    T series

                                         Cutting feedrate




     3 When "to" is inserted between two parameter numbers, there are parameters
       with successive numbers between the two starting and ending parameter
       numbers, but those intermediate parameter numbers are omitted for
       convenience.
     4 The lower-case letter "x" or "s" following the name of a bit-type parameter
       indicates the following:
       -”       x” : Bit axis type parameters
       -”       s” : Bit spindle type parameters

Notes
   (1) Values are rounded up or down to the nearest multiples of the minimum data unit.
   (2) A valid data range means data input limits, and may differ from values representing actual
       performance.
   (3) For information on the ranges of commands to the CNC, refer to Appendix D, "LIST OF
       COMMAND RANGES," in the "OPERATOR’S MANUAL" (B-64304EN).

                The input/output device connected to a channel (such as RS-232-C serial port 1 and
                RS-232-C serial port 2) can be selected by setting I/O CHANNEL (parameter No. 0020).
                The specifications (input/output specification number, baud rate, and the number of stop
                bits) of an input/output device connected to each channel must be set in the parameters
                corresponding to each channel beforehand.
                For channel 1, two combinations of parameters to specify the input/output device data are
                provided.
                The following shows the interrelation between the input/output device interface
                parameters for the channels.

                   The CNC has the following interfaces for transferring data to and from an external
                   input/output device and the host computer:
                   •     Input/output device interface (RS-232-C serial ports 1 and 2)
                   •     Memory card interface
                   •     Data server interface
                   •     Embedded Ethernet interface
                   •     USB memory interface
                   By setting bit 0 (IO4) of parameter No. 0110, data input/output can be controlled
                   separately. When IO4 is not set, data input/output is performed using the channel set in
                   parameter No. 0020. When IO4 is set, a channel can be assigned to each of foreground
                   input, foreground output, background input, and background output.
                   In these parameters, specify the interface connected to each input/output device to and
                   from which data is to be transferred. See the table below for these settings.
                   To execute the DNC operation or M198 command with FOCAS2/Ethernet, set this
                   parameter to 6.

                    NOTE
                    1 The setting of this parameter becomes valid when the power is
                      turned on or this parameter is modified. After this parameter is set,
                      the power need not be turned off then back on.
                    2 A setting modification made on the PMC online setting screen is
                      not reflected in this parameter.
                    3 The communication settings of a baud rate and so forth for using
                      RS-232-C made on the PMC online setting screen are valid. When
                      no modification is ever made to the settings on the PMC online
                      setting screen, the baud rate is 9600, parity is not used, and the
                      number of stops bits is 2.
                    4 Be sure to set 255 in this parameter to change the state of the
                      PMC online connection function from valid to invalid. Even if 0 is
                      set in this parameter, the function does not become invalid.
                    5 When the PMC online connection function occupies RS-232C or
                      High-speed interface, if other functions try to use RS-232C or
                      High-speed interface, warning "CANNOT USE I/O DEVICE" is
                      issued.

                        NOTE
                        1 The state in which a reference position has not been established
                          refers to the following state:
                         - When an absolute position detector is not used and reference
                            position return has not been performed even once after power-up
                         - When an absolute position detector is used and the association of
                            the machine position with the position detected with the absolute
                            position detector has not been completed (See the description of
                            bit 4 (APZx) of parameter No. 1815.)
                        2 When the Cs axis coordinates are to be set up, set this parameter
                          to 0.
                        3 To use a function that establishes the reference point and makes a
                          movement with a command other than G28, such as an axis of Cs
                          contour control, set this parameter to 1.

      #3       HJZx When a reference position is already set:
                    0: Manual reference position return is performed with deceleration dogs.
                    1: Manual reference position return is performed using rapid traverse without
                          deceleration dogs, or manual reference position return is performed with
                          deceleration dogs, depending on the setting of bit 7 (SJZ) of parameter No.0002.
                    When the function for setting the reference position without dogs (see the description of
                    bit 1 (DLZx) of parameter No. 1005) is used, manual reference position return after a
                    reference position is set is always performed at a parameter-set feedrate, regardless of the
                    setting of HJZx.

                          No.1405 is set to 0 when positioning of linear interpolation type is
                          used.

                0: Invalid
                1: Valid

                        NOTE
                          Be sure to set "1" to this parameter if bit 5 (EDR) of parameter
                          No.1405 is set to 0 when positioning of linear interpolation type is
                          used.

     #6    MCCx If a multi-axis amplifier is used, and another axis of the same amplifier is placed in the
                control axis detach state, the MCC signal of the servo amplifier is:
                0: Turned off.
                1: Not turned off.

                 NOTE
                   This parameter can be set for a control axis.

                    WARNING
                 1 When this parameter is set to 1, the dynamic brake does not
                   operate during removal of an axis. Therefore, if a failure occurs in
                   the mechanical brake, driving circuit, or sequence, a vertical axis
                   may fall freely in a significant manner. Since an excess error
                   check cannot also be performed during removal of an axis, set this
                   parameter to 0 for a vertical axis.
                 2 When the servo motor of a controlled axis to be detached is
                   connected to a multi-axis amplifier such as a two-axis amplifier,
                   placing the axis in the control axis detach state causes the
                   activating current in the amplifier to drop. As a result, alarm
                   (SV0401) "V READY OFF" is issued in the other axes. This alarm
                   can be suppressed by setting this parameter bit.
                   With this method, however, the target axis for the control axis
                   detach operation is placed in the servo off state (the amplifier
                   remains on, but no current flows through the motor). The torque of
                   the target axis becomes 0, so care should be taken. Even when a
                   controlled axis has been detached, detaching a cable (a command
                   cable or feedback cable) of the axis causes an alarm.
                   In such applications, it is impossible to perform a control axis
                   detach operation with a multi-axis amplifier by setting this
                   parameter bit. (Prepare a single-axis amplifier.)

                       NOTE
                         For the FS0i-C, one of the following changes is required besides

                         on diameter specification achieves the specified amount of
                         movement.
                         • Halve the command multiplication (the detection unit is not
                            changed).

                   position return feedrate FL even if the deceleration dog is pressed, but a movement
                   is made at the rapid traverse rate.

                If the deceleration dog is released after a movement at the rapid traverse rate and the
                deceleration dog is then pressed again and released after the rotation axis makes one

                   NOTE
                     IDGx is enabled when the IDG parameter (bit 7 of parameter
                     No.1002) is 1.
                     If the function for setting the reference position without dogs is
                     used, and the reference position is lost in absolute position
                     detection for a cause, the alarm (DS0300) is issued when the
                     power is turned on again.
                     If the operator performs reference position return, as a result of
                     mistakenly identifying the alarm as that requesting the operator to
                     perform a normal reference position return, an invalid reference
                     position may be set. To prevent such an operator error, the IDGx
                     parameter is provided to prevent the reference position from being
                     set again without dogs.
                     (1) If the IDG parameter (bit 7 of parameter No.1002) is set to 1,
                          the IDGx parameter (bit 0 of parameter No.1012) is
                          automatically set to 1 when the reference position is set using
                          the function for setting the reference position without dogs.
                          This prevents the reference position from being set again
                          without dogs.
                     (2) Once the reference position is prevented from being set for an
                          axis again, without dogs, any attempt to set the reference
                          position for the axis without dogs results in the output of an
                          alarm (PS0301).
                     (3) When the reference position must be set again without dogs,
                          set IDGx (bit 0 of parameter No.1012) to 0 before setting the
                          reference position.

                   can be selected by a parameter on an axis-by-axis basis. So, the unit of those parameters

                          The setting of this parameter is valid only when the system used is
                          the M series and bit 6 (DAL) of parameter No. 3104 is set to 1. If
                          this parameter is set to 1 in other than the above conditions, the
                          system operates as if this parameter bit were set to 0.

                      If the stored stroke limit check is enabled, the machine coordinate value present
                      immediately before the power is turned off is stored.
                      The machine coordinate value is set immediately after the power is turned on.
                      Based on the machine coordinate value, absolute coordinate and relative coordinate
                      values are set.

                        NOTE
                          Because this function uses software to store machine coordinates,
                          the function puts an extra load on the system. So, this function
                          should not be set for axes that do not require this function. The
                          amount of a movement made while the power is off is not reflected
                          in machine coordinates immediately after the power is turned on.

                     If this parameter is set to 1, a check is made before a retraction to
                     see that the specified feedrate has become 0 (the delay in
                     acceleration/deceleration has become 0). For retraction, the rapid
                     traverse rate (parameter No. 1420) is used, regardless of the
                     setting of parameter No. 1466. When this parameter is set to 0,
                     parameter No. 1466 is used as the feedrate for retraction. As
                     acceleration/deceleration used for retraction, only
                     acceleration/deceleration after interpolation is used. Rapid traverse
                     before look-ahead interpolation is disabled.

                                                                    override

                      Set a minimum deceleration ratio (MDR) for an inner circular cutting feedrate change by
                      automatic corner override.

                      In the case of circular cutting offset inward, the actual feedrate is determined by a
                      specified feedrate (F) as follows:
                             Rc          Rc: Radius of tool center
                       F×                    path
                             Rp          Rp: Programmed radius
                      Thus, the feedrate along the programmed path satisfies the specified value of F.



                                                                              Programmed path

                                               Rp




                      However, if Rc is too small when compared with Rp, Rc/Rp    0 results to stop the tool.
                      So, a minimum deceleration ratio (MDR) is set, and the feedrate of the tool is set to
                      F×(MDR) when Rc/Rp ≤ MDR.

                        NOTE
                          When this parameter is set to 0, the minimum deceleration ratio
                          (MDR) is 100%.

                      When θ ≤ θp, an inner corner is assumed. (Parameter No. 1711 is used to set θp.)
                      When a corner is determined to be an inner corner, an override is applied to the feedrate
                      in the range of Le in the previous block from the intersection of the corner and in the
                      range of Ls in the next block from the intersection of the corner.
                      Distances Le and Ls represent linear distances from the intersection of a corner to points
                      on the tool center path.
                      Le and Ls are set in parameter No. 1713 and No. 1714.

                      rate specified in parameter No. 1735.
                      If the radius of an arc is very small, a calculated feedrate may become too low.
                      In such a case, the feedrate is prevented from decreasing below the value specified in this

                      If a different value is set in this parameter for each axis, a feedrate is determined from the

                      In feedrate control based on acceleration change at a corner between linear interpolation
                      operations, the maximum allowable acceleration change rate not set in parameter
                      No.1788 but set in this parameter is valid.
                      For an axis with 0 set in this parameter, the maximum allowable acceleration change rate
                      set in parameter No.1788 is valid.
                      Feedrate control based on acceleration change is disabled for an axis with 0 set in
                      parameter No.1788, so that the setting of this parameter for such an axis is ignored.

                   1: Enabled
                   Feed-forward is enabled only in normal cutting feed. When this parameter is set to 1,
                   feed-forward is enabled in rapid traverse as well. This capability reduces the servo
                   positional deviation, thus reducing the time required to enter the in-position width at the

        #4     CCI As the in-position width for cutting feed:
                   0: The parameter (No. 1826) applicable to rapid traverse as well is used.
                   1: The parameter (No. 1827) dedicated to cutting feed is used.
                   This parameter enables the in-position width for cutting feed (parameter No. 1827) to be
                   set instead of the in-position width for rapid traverse (parameter No. 1826).
                   By setting bit 4 (CCI) of parameter No. 1801, choose whether to use this function or the
                   conventional in-position check function.
                   This function, when specified, is enabled for all axes. So, for an axis that does not require
                   this function, set the same data in parameter No. 1826 and No. 1827.

        #5     CIN When CCI is set to 1, the dedicated parameter for specifying an in-position width for
                   cutting feed is used:
                   0: Only when the next block specifies cutting feed.
                   1: Regardless of the next block.
                   The table below indicates the relationships between the parameters for cutting feed and
                   rapid traverse.

                          running state and no braking force is applied. Therefore, for a
                          vertical axis, if a failure occurs in the mechanical brake, driving

                    4 When this parameter is set, machine position and position on

                      Consequently, the parameter APZ (No. 1815#4: indicating that the
                      correspondence is established) is set to 0, alarm DS0300. Why the
                      parameter APZ (No. 1815#4) is set to 0 can be checked using
                      diagnostic data No. 310#0.
                    5 Absolute coordinate value is set by machine coordinate value.
                      However, after CNC turns on, the workpiece offset such as G92
                      and G52 executed before CNC turns off is not set.
                    6 This function cannot be used together with the parameter SCRx
                      (No.1817#3) that convert scale data.
                    7 In the case that the amount of one rotation of rotary axis is 360, the
                      parameter No.1869 is set to 0. Moreover, set the parameter
                      No.1240 to 0.
                    8 If it is necessary to set an amount of one rotation of rotary axis
                      arbitrarily, the parameter No.1869 is set to the amount of one
                      rotation. Moreover, set the parameter No.1240 to 0.

                      marks or a linear scale with an absolute address zero point
                      (full-closed system).

      #2   DCLx As a separate position detector, a linear scale with reference marks or a linear scale with
                an absolute address zero point is:
                0: Not used.
                1: Used.

                0: A rotary encoder with absolute address reference marks is not used.
                1: A rotary encoder with absolute address reference marks is used.

                    NOTE
                      When using a rotary encoder with absolute address reference
                      marks, set also bit 2 (DCLx) of parameter No. 1815 to 1.

      #4   APZx Machine position and position on absolute position detector when the absolute position
                detector is used
                0: Not corresponding

                When an absolute position detector is used, after primary adjustment is performed or after
                the absolute position detector is replaced, this parameter must be set to 0, power must be
                turned off and on, then manual reference position return must be performed. This
                completes the positional correspondence between the machine position and the position
                on the absolute position detector, and sets this parameter to 1 automatically.

                     pulses per rotation of the pulse coder]

                     As the size of the reference counter, specify the grid interval for the reference position

                     The setting of a command multiplier is as follows:
                     (1) When command multiplier is 1 to 1/27
                          Set value = 1 / command multiplier + 100

                     (2) When command multiply is 0.5 to 48
                          Set value = 2 × command multiplier
                          Valid data range : 1 to 96

                       NOTE
                       1 If a feedrate exceeding the feedrate found by the expression below
                         is used, an incorrect travel amount may result or a servo alarm may
                         be issued. Be sure to use a feedrate not exceeding the feedrate
                         found by the following expression:
                         Fmax[mm/min] = 196602 × 104 × least command increment / CMR
                       2 For the FS0i-C, one of the following changes is required besides
                         setting bit 3 (DIAx) of parameter No. 1006 so that the axis based
                         on diameter specification achieves the specified amount of
                         movement.
                         • Halve the command multiplication (the detection unit is not
                             changed).
                         • Halve the detection unit and double the flexible feed gear
                             (DMR).
                         For the FS0i-D, only if bit 3 (DIAx) of parameter No. 1006 is set,
                         the CNC halves the specified pulse. Accordingly, the above
                         changes are not required (when the detection unit is not changed).
                         To halve the detection unit, double both CMR and DMR.

                         When this parameter is set, the power must be turned off before

       1825                                           Servo loop gain for each axis

[Valid data range]   1 to 9999
                     Set the loop gain for position control for each axis.
                     When the machine performs linear and circular interpolation (cutting), the same value
                     must be set for all axes. When the machine requires positioning only, the values set for
                     the axes may differ from one another. As the loop gain increases, the response by position
                     control is improved. A too large loop gain, however, makes the servo system unstable.
                     The relationship between the positioning deviation (the number of pulses counted by the
                     error counter) and the feedrate is expressed as follows:
                        Positioning deviation = Feedrate / (60 × Loop gain)
                        Unit : Positioning deviation mm, inch or deg
                               Feedrate mm/min, inch/min, or deg/min

[Valid data range]   0 to 99999999
                     The in-position width is set for each axis.
                     When the deviation of the machine position from the specified position (the absolute
                     value of the positioning deviation) is smaller than the in-position width, the machine is
                     assumed to have reached the specified position. (The machine is in the in-position state.)

       1827                                   In-position width in cutting feed for each axis

    [Unit of data]   Detection unit
[Valid data range]   0 to 99999999
                     Set an in-position width for each axis in cutting feed. This parameter is used when bit 4
                     (CCI) of parameter No.1801=1.

       1828                                Positioning deviation limit for each axis in movement

[Valid data range]   0 to 99999999
                     Set the positioning deviation limit in movement for each axis.
                     If the positioning deviation exceeds the positioning deviation limit during movement, a
                     servo alarm (SV0411) is generated, and operation is stopped immediately (as in
                     emergency stop).
                     Generally, set the positioning deviation for rapid traverse plus some margin in this
                     parameter.

    [Unit of data]   Detection unit
[Valid data range]   0 to 99999999
                     Set the positioning deviation limit in the stopped state for each axis.
                     If, in the stopped state, the positioning deviation exceeds the positioning deviation limit
                     set for stopped state, a servo alarm (SV0410) is generated, and operation is stopped
                     immediately (as in emergency stop).

       1830                                Axis-by-axis positional deviation limit at servo-off time


      [Input type]   Parameter input
       [Data type]   2-word axis
    [Unit of data]   Detection unit
[Valid data range]   0 to 99999999
                     This parameter is used to set a positional deviation limit at servo-off time, on an
                     axis-by-axis basis.
                     If the value specified with this parameter is exceeded at servo-off time, a servo alarm is
                     issued to cause an immediate stop (same as an emergency stop). Usually, set the same
                     value as a positional deviation at stop time.

                       NOTE
                         When this parameter is set to 0, no positional deviation limit check
                         is made at servo-off time.

      [Input type]   Parameter input
       [Data type]   Word axis
    [Unit of data]   Detection unit
[Valid data range]   0 to 32767
                     This parameter sets a servo error used to enable reference position return.
                     In general, set this parameter to 0. (When 0 is set, 128 is assumed as the default.)
                     If, during reference position return, such a feedrate as exceeding a set value is not reached
                     even once before the limit switch for deceleration is released (the deceleration signal
                     (*DEC) is set to 1 again), the alarm (PS0090) "REFERENCE POSITION RETURN
                     FAILURE" is issued.
                     If, during reference position return, such a feedrate as exceeding a set servo error amount
                     is not reached even once before the limit switch for deceleration is released (the
                     deceleration signal is set to 1 again), the alarm (PS0090) "REFERENCE POSITION
                     RETURN FAILURE" is issued.

                       NOTE
                         When bit 0 (PLC0) of parameter No. 2000 is 1, a check is
                         performed with a value 10 times as large as the parameter setting.
                         (Example)
                           When bit 0 (PLC0) of parameter No. 2000 is 1 and the setting is
                           10, if the number of servo errors is 100 or more, a reference
                           position return is enabled.

                     is valid when RBK, #4 of parameter 1800, is set to 1.) More precise machining can be
                     performed by changing the backlash compensating value depending on the feedrate, the
                     cutting feed or the rapid traverse positioning. Let the measured backlash at cutting feed be
                     A and the measured backlash at rapid traverse be B. The backlash compensating value is
                     shown below depending on the change of feedrate (cutting feed or rapid traverse) and the
                     change of the direction of movement.

                         return is completed after the power is turned on. The normal
                         backlash compensation is performed according to the value
                         specified in parameter No.1851 irrespective of a rapid traverse
                         and a cutting feed.
                       3 The backlash compensation depending on a rapid traverse and a
                         cutting feed is performed only when bit 4 (RBK) of parameter
                         No.1800 is set to 1. When RBK is set to 0, the normal backlash is
                         performed.

                      Normally, the amount of one rotation of rotary axis is 360, and the machine position 0 is

                       NOTE
                       1 Set parameter Nos. 1883 and 1884 so that the distance from the
                         scale zero point (for a linear scale with absolute address reference
                         marks) or the base point (for a linear scale with an absolute
                         address zero point) to the reference position is within the range
                         from -999,999,999,999 to +999,999,999,999. If a value beyond this
                         range is set, an alarm (PS 5325) is issued.
                       2 The scale area on the scale cannot be extended across the scale
                         zero point or base point. Make parameter settings not to cause the
                         scale area to extend beyond the scale zero point or base point.

                         used.
                    •    When a two-axis amplifier is used, the use of the fast type for both axes is not
                         allowed. The slow type can be used for both axes.
                    •    When a three-axis amplifier is used, the requirement for a two-axes amplifier
                         described above applies to the first and second axes, and the requirement for a
                         one-axis amplifier, again described above, applies to the third axis.
                    •    When an odd number is specified for parameter No.1023, the fast type interface
                         must be used. However, the slow type may be used for high-speed current loop axis
                         and high-speed interface axis.
                    •    When an even number is specified for parameter No.1023, only the slow type
                         interface can be used. (The FSL bit must always be set to 1.)

      [Input type] Byte
[Valid data range] 0 to 3, 16, 40, 48
                   These parameters set address conversion table values for slaves 1 to 10.
                   A slave is the generic name given to a device such as a servo amplifier or separate
                   detector interface unit, connected to the CNC via an FSSB optical cable. Smaller numbers,
                   starting from 1 are assigned to slaves closer to the CNC; the maximum number that can
                   be assigned is 10. A two-axis amplifier has two slaves, while a three-axis amplifier has
                   three slaves. Set each parameter as described below, depending on whether the slave is an
                   amplifier or separate detector interface unit, or when no slave exists.

                  •     When the slave is an amplifier:
                        Set the value obtained by subtracting 1 from the setting of parameter No.1023 for
                        the axis to which the amplifier is assigned.
                  •     When the slave is a separate detector interface unit:
                        Set 16 for the first separate detector interface unit (closest to the CNC).
                        Set 48 for the second separate detector interface unit (furthest from the CNC).
                  •     When no slave exists
                        Set 40.

                      NOTE
                      1 When using the simple electric gear box (EGB) function
                        The EGB axis (axis set with parameter No.7771) does not actually
                        require an amplifier. So, assume that the EGB axis is connected to
                        a dummy amplifier. Accordingly, as the address conversion table
                        value for a nonexistent slave, set the value obtained by subtracting
                        1 from the setting made for parameter No.1023 for the EGB axis,
                        instead of setting 40.
                      2 When automatic setting mode is selected for FSSB setting (when
                        bit 0 (FMD) of parameter No.1902 is set to 0), parameters No.1910
                        to No.1919 are automatically set when input is performed with the
                        FSSB setting screen. When manual setting 2 mode is selected for
                        FSSB setting (when bit 0 (FMD) of parameter No.1902 is set to 1),
                        parameter No.1910 to No.1919 must be directly set.

                         smaller, the permissible feedrate limited by the internal processing of the servo
                         software lowers in proportion to the detection unit (when a detection unit of 0.1 μm
                         is changed to 0.05μm, the permissible feedrate is halved).
                    (*2) In a semi-closed loop system using a high-resolution detector (a rotary motor or
                         linear motor), use of nano interpolation allows the maximum resolution of the
                         detector to be used for position control without using a smaller detection unit.

           (*3) Even when a large detection unit is to be used because the feedrate is limited by
                detection unit as mentioned above, feedrate feedback data that significantly affects
                velocity loop control is controlled by using a maximum resolution of the detector.

                         <2> The serial spindle detects the one-rotation signal.

                           To detect the one-rotation signal accurately, spindle orientation
                           must be performed. This operation must be performed just once
                           after the power is turned on and is not needed subsequently.
                           To determine whether the one-rotation signal has been detected or
                           not, check the serial spindle status signals (PC1DEA to PC1DED).

                   Nos.3294 and 3295 are used to set the range where such modification is disabled. In
                   parameter No.3294, set the offset number of the start of tool offset values whose
                   modification is disabled. In parameter No.3295, set the number of such values. In the

                   •     When 0 or a negative value is set in parameter No.3294
                   •     When 0 or a negative value is set in parameter No.3295

                         No.3294
                   In the following case, a modification to the values ranging from the value set in parameter
                   No.3294 to the maximum tool offset number is disabled:
                         When the value of parameter No.3294 added to the value of parameter No.3295
                         exceeds the maximum tool offset number
                   When the offset value of a prohibited number is input through the MDI panel, the

        [Example] When the following parameter settings are made, modifications to both of the tool
                   geometry offset values and tool wear offset values corresponding to offset numbers 51 to
                   60 are disabled:
                   •     Bit 1 (GOF) of parameter No.3290 = 1 (to disable tool geometry offset value
                         modification)
                   •     Bit 0 (WOF) of parameter No.3290 = 1 (to disable tool wear offset value
                         modification)
                   •     Parameter No.3294 = 51
                   •     Parameter No.3295 = 10
                   If the setting of bit 0 (WOF) of parameter No.3290 is set to 0 without modifying the other
                   parameter settings above, tool geometry offset value modification only is disabled, and
                   tool wear offset value modification is enabled.

   [Input type] Parameter input
    [Data type] Bit path

    #4     UVW When G code system B or C is selected:
               0: The U, V, W, and H commands are not the incremental commands of the X-, Y- , Z-,
                  and C-axes.
               1: The U, V, W, and H commands are the incremental commands of the X-, Y- , Z-,
                  and C-axes.

                   NOTE
                   1 When U-, V-, and W-axes are present, the U, V, and W commands
                     are assumed to be the commands for these axes. That is, they
                     are not the incremental commands of the X-, Y-, and Z-axes.
                   2 If this parameter is set to 1, it is impossible to use U, V, or W as the
                     specified address (parameter No. 3460) of the second auxiliary
                     function for G code system B or C.
                   3 If this parameter is set to 1, the same operation as that of the
                     FS0i-TC is assumed.

    #6     SMX An S code specified in a block that specifies G92 (G50 with G code system A of the T
               series) is:
               0: Regarded as a maximum spindle speed command.
               1: Not regarded as a maximum spindle speed command (but regarded as a spindle
                    speed command).

   [Input type] Parameter input
    [Data type] Bit path

     #0     DPI When a decimal point is omitted in an address that can include a decimal point
                0: The least input increment is assumed. (Normal decimal point input)
                1: The unit of mm, inches, degree, or second is assumed. (Pocket calculator type
                   decimal point input)

    #4     MAB Switching between the absolute and incremental commands in MDI operation
               0: Performed by G90 or G91
               1: Depending on the setting of bit 5 (ABS) of parameter No.3401

                   NOTE
                     When G code system A of the T series is used, this parameter is
                     invalid.

     #5    CIR When neither the distance (I, J, K) from a start point to the center nor an arc radius (R) is
               specified in circular interpolation (G02, G03) or helical interpolation (G02, G03):
               0: The tool moves to an end point by linear interpolation.
               1: An alarm PS0022 is issued.

    #6     ADB When the same address two or more times are specified in one block:
               0: The address specified last is valid.
               1: It is treated as a program error and the alarm PS5074, "ADDRESS DUPLICATION
                  ERROR" is issued.

                   NOTE
                   1 You can specify any number of G codes in the same block as long
                     as they belong to different groups. Specifying G codes belonging to
                     the same group causes the alarm PS5074. You can however
                     specify any number of G90 and G91 codes in the same block as
                     they cause no alarm.
                   2 When bit 7 (M3B) of parameter No.3404 is set to 1, up to three M
                     codes can be specified in the same block. Specifying more than
                     three results in the alarm PS5074.
                   3 When G code system A is used with the lathe system, specifying
                     an absolute programming and incremental programming for the
                     same axis causes the alarm PS5074.
                   4 The alarm is not caused by blocks which call a custom macro or
                     argument specification I/II of execution macro.

                         In memory card operation, the program number specification
                         format is used, regardless of the setting of this parameter.

        #4      M30 When M30 is specified in a memory operation:
                    0: M30 is sent to the machine, and the head of the program is automatically searched
                       for. So, when the ready signal FIN is returned and a reset or reset and rewind
                       operation is not performed, the program is executed, starting from the beginning.
                    1: M30 is sent to the machine, but the head of the program is not searched for. (The
                       head of the program is searched for by the reset and rewind signal.)

        #5      M02 When M02 is specified in memory operation
                    0: M02 is sent to the machine, and the head of the program is automatically searched
                       for. So, when the end signal FIN is returned and a reset or reset and rewind
                       operation is not performed, the program is executed, starting from the beginning.
                    1: M02 is sent to the machine, but the head of the program is not searched for. (The

                  setting type based on the position coder is:
                  0: Not performed.
                  1: Performed.

        #1     FPR Feed per revolution (without a position coder) is:
                   0: Not used for a spindle.
                   1: Used for a spindle.
                   In a machine that does not use a position coder, when bit 1 (FPR) of parameter No. 3729
                   is set to 1 for each axis, feed per revolution can be performed with a spindle command. A
                   feed per revolution is specified with G95 (G99 for T series) in the same way as for
                   normal operation.
                   When multispindle control is performed, the target spindle for feed per revolution is
                   selected with a position coder select signal (PC2SLC<Gn028.7>).

                       NOTE
                         Enable constant surface speed control (bit 0 (SSC) of parameter
                         No. 8133 is 1).

      #2      CSNs When the Cs contour control mode is turned off, an in-position check is:
                   0: Performed.
                   1: Not performed.

                       NOTE
                         If this parameter is set to 1, the same operation as in FS0i-C is
                         assumed.

      #3      NCSs When the Cs contour control mode is set:
                   0: Switching to Cs contour control is completed when the spindle activating current is
                      on (the spindle amplifier is ready for operation in the Cs contour control mode).
                   1: Switching to Cs contour control is completed even when the spindle activating
                      current is off (the spindle amplifier is not ready for operation in the Cs contour
                      control mode).

                     If this parameter is set to 1, the Cs contour control switch end signal is output without
                     waiting for the spindle to decelerate to a stop.

      #7      CSCs The increment system of the Cs contour control axis is:
                   0: IS-B.
                   1: IS-C.

                   Set the axis as the calculation reference in constant surface speed control.

                       NOTE
                         If 0 is set, constant surface speed control is always applied to the
                         X-axis. In this case, specifying P in a G96 block has no effect on
                         the constant surface speed control.

       3772                                              Maximum spindle speed


      [Input type]   Parameter input
       [Data type]   2-word spindle
    [Unit of data]   min-1
[Valid data range]   0 to 99999999
                     This parameter sets the maximum spindle speed.
                     When a command specifying a speed exceeding the maximum speed of the spindle is
                     specified , or the speed of the spindle exceeds the maximum speed because of the spindle
                     speed override function, the spindle speed is clamped at the maximum speed set in the
                     parameter.

                          CAUTION
                       1 If 0 is set in this parameter, the speed of the spindle is not
                         clamped.
                       2 When spindle speed command control is applied using the PMC,
                         this parameter has no effect, and the spindle speed is not clamped.

                       NOTE
                       1 For the M series, this parameter is valid when constant surface
                         speed control is selected (bit 0 (SSC) of parameter No. 8133 is 1).
                       2 When the constant surface speed control is selected, the spindle
                         speed is clamped at the maximum speed, regardless of whether
                         the G96 mode or G97 mode is specified.

      3773                           Internal relay address (R) to specify the maximum spindle speed


                      NOTE
                        When this parameter is set, the power must be turned off before
                        operation is continued.

      [Input type] Parameter input
       [Data type] Ｗord spindle
[Valid data range] 4 to maximum internal relay address (R) (multiple of 4: 4, 8, ...)
                   Set the start address of the internal relay address (R) to specify the maximum spindle
                   speed for each spindle. Four bytes of the internal relay address (R) from the start address
                   are used.
                   The spindle speed is clamped at the value that is specified with the internal relay address
                   (R).

                      NOTE
                      1 If 0 is set in this parameter, the speed of the spindle is not clamped
                        with an internal relay address (R).
                      2 Set a value that is a multiple of 4 (4, 8, etc.).
                      3 The range of the R address differs depending on the PMC kind and
                        the memory size. Check the specifications of the PMC, and set a
                        value within the valid range.
                        • PMC: R0 to R7999 (8000)
                        • PMC/L: R0 to R1499 (1500)
                        (Example: R addresses in the range from R0 to R1499 if PMC/L is
                        used. Thus, values which can be set are 4, 8, 12, 16, …1492, 1496)

                    NOTE
                    4 If an illegal value is set in this parameter, the alarm PW5390,
                      "R-ADDRESS SETTING IS ILLEGAL" occurs.

       3775                       Default P command value for spindle selection in multi-spindle control


                     NOTE
                       When this parameter is set, the power must be turned off before
                       operation is continued.

[Valid data range] 0 to 32767
                   When bit 3 (MPP) of parameter No. 3703 is set to 1 and bit 2 (MPA) of parameter No.
                   3706 is set to 1 in multi-spindle control, set a default P command value applicable if S_P_
                   is not specified even once after power-up.

       3781                               P code for selecting the spindle in multi-spindle control


      [Input type] Parameter input
       [Data type] Word spindle
[Valid data range] 0 to 32767
                   If bit 3 (MPP) of parameter No. 3703 is set to 1, set the P code to select each spindle
                   under multi-spindle control. Specify the P code in a block containing the S command.

       [Example] If the P code value for selecting the second spindle is set to 3,
                 S1000 P3;
                 causes the second spindle to rotate at S1000.

                     NOTE
                     1 This parameter is valid if bit 3 (MPP) of parameter No. 3703 is set
                       to 1.
                     2 If this parameter is set to 0, the corresponding spindle cannot be
                       selected by a P code.
                     3 Under 2-path control, the P code specified here is valid for each
                       path.
                       For instance, if the P code to select the first spindle of path 2 is set
                       to 21, specifying S1000 P21; in path 1 causes the first spindle of
                       path 2 to be rotated at S1000.
                     4 Identical P code values cannot be used for different spindles.
                       (Identical P code values cannot be used even if the paths are
                       different.)
                     5 When this parameter is used (when bit 3 (MPP) of parameter No.
                       3703 is set to 1), the spindle command selection signal is invalid.
                     6 To use this parameter, enable multi-spindle control (bit 3 (MSP) of
                       parameter No. 8133 is 1).

                    <Setting method>
                    First, select servo axes which perform interpolation with the Cs contouring axis. (Up to
                    four axes can be selected.)
                    When there is no servo axis for interpolation with the Cs contouring axis, set the
                    parameters 3900, 3910, 3920, and 3930 to 0 to terminate parameter setting.
                    When there are servo axes for interpolation with the Cs contouring axis, the parameters
                    must be set according to the procedure below for each axis.
                    (1) Set the number of a servo axis (1 to maximum number of controlled axes) for
                          interpolation with the Cs contouring axis in parameters 39n0 (n = 0, 1, 2, and 3).
                    (2) Set loop gain values of the servo axis specified in (1) above which is used when the
                          Cs contouring axis is controlled in parameters 39n1, 39n2, 39n3, and 39n4. (There
                          are four stages for main gears used.)
                    (3) When the number of specified servo axes is less than 4, set the remaining parameters
                          (39n0) to 0 to terminate parameter setting.
                    When the number of a Cs contouring axis is set to parameter 39n0, the parameter is
                    assumed to be set to 0.

                  NOTE
                  1 In general, it is difficult to set a high loop gain for a spindle motor
                    axis when compared with a servo axis. These parameters are
                    provided so that, by changing the loop gain of a servo axis that
                    requires interpolation with the Cs contour axis, interpolation control
                    can be exercised correctly between the Cs axis and servo axis
                    while the spindle exercises Cs contour control.
                  2 The loop gain of the servo axis is changed using the parameter
                    settings made for a spindle gear selected at the time of conversion
                    from the spindle mode to the Cs contour control mode.
                    In normal use, it is unlikely that the gear of the spindle is switched
                    during Cs contour control. However, note that if the gear of the
                    spindle is changed during Cs contour control, the loop gain of the
                    servo axis is not changed.
                  3 Even when multiple Cs axes are used with one path (bit 7 (CSS) of
                    parameter No. 3704 = 1), these parameters are shared.

                 NOTE
                 1 Among the parameters of the spindle amplifier with the serial
                   interface, parameters No. 4015 cannot be changed by the users.
                   These parameters require to assign optional software to the CNC
                   and are automatically set depending on the type of the software.
                   The setting of parameter No. 4371 is also unchangeable by the
                   user.
                 2 To set the parameters of the spindle amplifier with the serial
                   interface automatically, set #7 of parameter No.4019 to 1, assign
                   the model code of the motor to be used to parameter No.4133, turn
                   off the power of the CNC and spindle amplifier, and restart the
                   CNC and spindle amplifier.
                 3 Parameters No.4000 to No.4799 are used in the processing on the
                   spindle amplifier. For details of these parameters, refer to either of
                   the following manuals, depending on the serial spindle that is
                   actually used.

                       NOTE
                       5 The CNC stores the parameters of the spindle amplifier with the
                         serial interface. The CNC sends them to the spindle amplifier at the
                         system power on and they are used in the unit.
                         These parameters are sent from the CNC to the spindle amplifier in
                         a batch when:
                         - The CNC is switched on.
                         If these parameters are rewritten, they are sent from the CNC to
                         the spindle amplifier sequentially when:
                         - The parameters have been entered from the MDI.
                         - The parameters have been entered as programmable (G10).
                         - The parameters have been entered via the reader/punch
                         interface.
                         To set parameters automatically, upload parameters corresponding
                         to the motor model from the spindle amplifier to the CNC prior to
                         the procedure specified above.
                         The parameters of the spindle amplifier with serial interface can be
                         changed after the system starts. Changing the parameters
                         (No.4000 to No.4799 "S1" to "S8") in the CNC sends them to the
                         spindle amplifier at an appropriate time and the parameters in the
                         unit are updated.

                       parameter No. 4831 to 0. Spindle synchronization based on arbitrary spindles must
                       be enabled for the path to which a slave spindle belongs and for the path to which a

                   Two methods are available for specifying spindle positioning. One method uses axis
                   address for arbitrary-angle positioning. The other use an M code for half-fixed angle
                   positioning. This parameter sets an M code for the latter method.
                   In this parameter, set an M code to be used for half-fixed angle positioning based on M
                   codes.
                   Six M code from Mα to M(α+5) are used for half-fixed angle positioning, when α is the
                   value of this parameter.
                   •     When the number of M codes is set in parameter No. 4964, let α be the value set in
                         parameter No. 4962, and let β be the value set in parameter No. 4964. Then, β M
                         codes from Mα to M(α+β-1) are used as M codes for half-fixed angle positioning
                         based on M codes.
                   The table below indicates the relationship between the M codes and positioning angles.

                   codes.
                   As many M codes as the number specified in this parameter, starting with the M code
                   specified in parameter No.4962, are used to specify half-fixed angle positioning.
                   Let α be the value of parameter No.4962, and let β be the value of parameter No.4964.

                       When this parameter is set, the power must be turned off before

                   Ensure that the total number of values set in parameter No. 5024 for the individual paths
                   is within the number of compensation values usable in the entire system.
                   If the total number of values set in parameter No. 5024 for the individual paths exceeds
                   the number of compensation values usable in the entire system, or 0 is set in parameter
                   No. 5024 for all paths, the number of compensation values usable for each path is a value
                   obtained by dividing the number of compensation values usable in the entire system by
                   the number of paths.
                   Tool compensation values as many as the number of compensation values used for each
                   path are displayed on the screen. If tool compensation numbers more than the number of
                   compensation values usable for each path are specified, an alarm is issued.
                   For example, 100 tool compensation sets are used, 120 sets may be allocated to path 1
                   and 80 sets to path 2. All of 200 sets need not be used.

                   When 0 is set, the number of digits is determined by the number of tool compensation

                   When using memories common to paths, set the number of common tool compensation
                   values in this parameter.
                   Ensure that the setting of this parameter does not exceed the number of tool compensation
                   values set for each path (parameter No. 5024).

                   made common.
     [Example 2] When parameter No. 5029 = 20 and the other conditions are the same as for Example 1,
                   tool compensation numbers 1 to 15 are made common.

                      NOTE

                 direction, the alarm (PS0064 or PS0329) is issued. When a program is created
                 automatically, a very small unmonotonous figure may be produced. Set an unsigned
                 allowable value for such an unmonotonous figure. By doing so, G71 and G72 cycles can
                 be executed even in a program including an unmonotonous figure.
       [Example] Suppose that a G71 command where the direction of the cutting axis (X-axis) is minus
                 and the direction of the roughing axis (Z-axis) is minus is specified. In such a case, when
                 an unmonotonous command for moving 0.001 mm in the plus direction along the Z-axis
                 is specified in a target figure program, roughing can be performed according to the
                 programmed figure without an alarm by setting 0.001 mm in this parameter.

                      NOTE
                        A check for a monotonous figure is made at all times during G71
                        and G72 cycles. A figure (programmed path) is checked. When tool
                        nose radius compensation is performed, a path after compensation
                        is checked. When bit 2 (FCK) of parameter No. 5104 is set to 1, a
                        check is made before G71or G72 cycle operation. In this case, not
                        a path after tool nose radius compensation but a programmed path
                        is checked.

                 the alarm (PS0064 or PS0329) is issued. When a program is created automatically, a very
                 small unmonotonous figure may be produced. Set an unsigned allowable value for such
                 an unmonotonous figure. By doing so, G71 and G72 cycles can be executed even in a
                 program including an unmonotonous figure.
                 The allowable value is clamped to the depth of cut specified by a multiple repetitive
                 canned cycle.
       [Example] Suppose that a G71 command where the direction of the cutting axis (X-axis) is minus
                 and the direction of the roughing axis (Z-axis) is minus is specified. In such a case, when
                 an unmonotonous command for moving 0.001 mm in the minus direction along the
                 X-axis is specified in a target figure program for moving from the bottom of cutting to the
                 end point, roughing can be performed according to the programmed figure without an
                 alarm by setting 0.001 mm in this parameter.

                   fine boring cycle or back boring cycle. For each boring axis, an axis and direction for tool
                   retraction after orientation can be set. Set a signed axis number. To use a fine boring
                   cycle or back boring cycle in the tilted working plane indexing, set the retract direction
                   when the absolute coordinate value of the rotation axis is 0.

       [Example] Suppose that:
                 When the boring axis is the X-axis, the tool retraction direction after orientation is -Y.
                 When the boring axis is the Y-axis, the tool retraction direction after orientation is +Z.
                 When the boring axis is the Z-axis, the tool retraction direction after orientation is -X.
                 Then, set the following (assuming that the first, second, and third axes are the X-axis,
                 Y-axis, and Z-axis, respectively):
                 Set -2 in the parameter for the first axis. (The tool retraction direction is -Y.)
                 Set 3 in the parameter for the second axis. (The tool retraction direction is -Y.)
                 Set -1 in the parameter for the third axis. (The tool retraction direction is -X.)
                 Set 0 for other axes.

                     This parameter sets an override value for the feedrate of retraction in a boring cycle. The
                     cutting feedrate override signal is valid, regardless of the setting of this parameter. The
                     setting of this parameter is valid even when the override cancel signal is set to 1.
                     When 0 is set in this parameter, the following operation is performed:
                     For the T series
                     Operation performed when 200 is set in this parameter (The retraction feedrate is two
                     times greater than the cutting feedrate.)

       #0     IXSx When a command is specified in a block that contains a command for the index table
                   indexing axis:
                   0 : An alarm (PS1564) is issued.
                   1 : The command is executed.

                    If bit 6 (SIM) of parameter No.5500 is set to 1, a simultaneous operation with all axes
                    except the index table indexing axis can be performed regardless of the setting of this
                    parameter.
                    To set an axis that allows simultaneous operation for each axis, set SIM to 0, and set this
                    parameter.

                      NOTE
                        Even when this parameter is set to 1, an alarm (PS1564) is issued

                   This parameter sets the number of a controlled axis to be used as the index table indexing
                   axis.
                   When the setting value is 0, it is assumed that the fourth axis is the index table indexing
                   axis if the number of control axes is four or more,
                   and is assumed that the final axis is the index table indexing axis if the number of control

                      1 to 99999999:
                            The rotation for the index table indexing axis is always performed in the positive
                            direction. Rotation in the negative direction is performed only when the M code
                            set in this parameter is specified together with a movement command.

                        NOTE

                      This parameter sets the minimum positioning angle (travel distance) for the index table
                      indexing axis. The travel distance specified in the positioning command must always be
                      an integer multiple of this setting. When 0 is set, the travel distance is not checked.
                      The minimum positioning angle is checked not only for the command, but also for the
                      coordinate system setting and workpiece origin offset.

                        NOTE
                          When the setting is 0, specification can be performed regardless of
                          the minimum angle.

                 When bell-shaped acceleration/deceleration is specified, T1=T/2 and T2=T/2 are obtained
                 as with normal acceleration/deceleration after cutting feed interpolation, where T is the
                 time constant. Therefore, the acceleration/deceleration type includes no linear part. To
                 specify bell-shaped acceleration/deceleration, the option for bell-shaped
                 acceleration/deceleration after cutting feed interpolation is required.

                   NOTE
                     In this case, the acceleration/deceleration type is set in bits 0 and 1
                     of parameter No. 1610, and the time constant is set in parameter
                     No. 1622.

                     parameter (No.6405), the rapid traverse rate is clamped to an override of 100%. This
                     function is invalid if 0 is set in parameter (No.6405). In this case, the setting of bit 0
                     (RPO) of parameter No. 6400 is used.

                 The distance traveled by the machine when the manual handle is actually turned can be
                 found by the following expression:
                 [Specified speed] × [Handle magnification] × ([Setting of this parameter]/100) ×
                 (8/60000) (mm or inch)
       [Example] When a specified feedrate is 30mm/min, the manual handle magnification is 100, and
                 parameter No. 6410 is set to 1, the travel distance per pulse generated from the manual
                 pulse generator is calculated as follows:
                 [Travel distance per pulse]=30[mm/min] × 100 × (1/100) × (8/60000)[min]= 0.004mm

                   Set a group of M codes output during backward movement.
                   For backward movement for an M code, the modal M code in the same group set by the
                   parameter is output.
                   The first M code in each group is set as the default.
                   When the number of M codes in a group is 3 or less, set the parameter corresponding to
                   an unused M code to 0.
                   For backward movement for "M0", "M0" is output regardless of which M code is set for
                   the parameter. "0" set in the parameter is ignored.
                   For an M code which is not set in any group by any of the above parameters, the M code
                   for forward movement is output.
                   With these parameters, an M code in the same group can be output in backward
                   movement only when the M code is the first M code in each block. When a block
                   contains two or more M codes, the same M codes as output in forward movement are
                   output as a second M code and up.

                   - For tool management function
                   When an M code for tool life count restart is specified, the counting of the life of the tool
                   attached at the spindle position is started.
                   When the type for counting the number of use times is selected, the target of life counting
                   is switched to the tool attached at the spindle position, and the life count is incremented
                   by 1.
                   When the type for counting time is selected, the target of life counting is switched to the
                   tool attached at the spindle position, with no other operations performed.

                      NOTE
                        If this parameter is set to 0, the "@" mark (indicating that the tool is
                        in use) is kept displayed unless the next tool whose life has not
                        expired is used. If this parameter is set to 1, marks are displayed in
                        different ways depending on the life count type.
                        If the life count type is the duration specification type, the "*" mark
                        (indicating that the life has expired) appears when the life has
                        expired. If the life count type is the count specification type, one
                        count is not assumed until the end of the program (M02, M30, and so
                        on). Therefore, even when the life value and the tool life counter
                        value match, the "*" mark (life has expired) does not appear. The "*"
                        mark (life has expired) appears when the tool is used again by a tool
                        group command (T code) or tool change command (M06) issued
                        after the CNC is reset.

       #7      M6E When a T code is specified in the same block as M06:
                   0: The T code is treated as a back number or the group number to be selected next.
                      Which number is assumed depends on the setting of bit 7 (M6T) of parameter No.
                      6800.
                   1: Life counting for the tool group starts immediately.

                   The T code (tool life management group command) specified after the tool life count
                   restart M code selects a tool whose life has not expired from a specified group, and the
                   next M06 command increments the tool life counter by one.
                   When the life is specified by duration, specifying the tool life count restart M code causes
                   nothing. When 0 is set in this parameter, the tool life count restart M code is invalid.

                   COF(No.7602#5) is set to 0), the phase shift direction is:

                         The rotation directions and phase shift directions of the master axis
                         and polygon synchronization axis in the spindle-spindle polygon
                         turning mode can be reversed with a programmed command. MNG,

                   COF(No.7602#5) is set to 0), this parameter selects the spindle that is subject to a phase
                   shift operation for phase synchronization:
                   0: The polygon synchronization axis is selected.
                   1: The master axis is selected.

                       NOTE

                       2 Spindle operation for phase synchronization is performed with both
                         spindles.

                   COF(No.7602#5) is set to 0), and spindle-spindle polygon turning mode is specified:
                   0: Spindle-spindle polygon turning mode is entered with the current spindle speed
                      maintained.
                   1: Spindle-spindle polygon turning mode is entered after the spindle is stopped.

                       NOTE
                         This parameter can be used, for example, when single-rotation
                         signal detection cannot be guaranteed at an arbitrary feedrate
                         because a separate detector is installed to detect the spindle
                         single-rotation signal, as when a built-in spindle is used. (When bit
                         7 (RFCHK3) of parameter No.4016 for the serial spindle is set to 1,
                         together with this parameter, a single-rotation signal detection
                         position in spindle-spindle polygon turning mode is guaranteed.)

                   NOTE
                     When the use of phase control is not selected, the steady state is
                     reached in a shorter time because phase synchronization control is
                     not applied. Once steady rotation is achieved, however, polygon
                     turning must be completed without changing the steady state. (If a
                     spindle speed change including a spindle stop is made, a phase
                     shift occurs, so that polygon turning is not performed normally.)

                     The speed of the slave spindle under speed ratio control in spindle synchronization
                     control is clamped so that the speed does not exceed the value set in this parameter.

                       NOTE
                       1 This parameter sets the speed of the slave spindle to an integral
                         multiple of the speed of the master spindle in the spindle
                         synchronization control function.
                       2 There is no relation with the polygon machining function.

                         be sure to set this parameter. When 0 is set, the speed is clamped
                         to 0, disabling rotation under spindle synchronization.

                       Therefore, set 80000 for parameter No. 7772.

                       160000 cannot be divided by 3 without a remainder. In this case, change the setting of

                       indicates the value you want to set.
                                       160000

                       Therefore, set 160000 for parameter No. 7772 and 1080000 for parameter No. 7773.
                       As described above, all the settings of parameters Nos. 7772 and 7773 have to do is to
                       indicate the ratio correctly. So, you can reduce the fraction indicated by the settings. For
                       example, you may set 16 for parameter No. 7772 and 108 for parameter No. 7773 for this
                       case.

                          calculated from the current machine coordinates and the workpiece
                          coordinates for each axis at the reference position set in parameter
                          No.1250.

      #3    SCMx When workpiece coordinates are calculated in synchronous control:
                 0: The workpiece coordinates are calculated from the machine coordinates of the slave
                    axis.
                 1: The workpiece coordinates are calculated from the machine coordinates of the
                    master axis and slave axis.

      #4    SCDx The positive (+) directions of the master axis and slave axis in the coordinate system in
                 synchronous control are:
                 0: Identical.
                 1: Opposite.
                 Set the parameters SPMx, SPSx, SCMx, and SCDx for the master axis. These settings are
                 referenced during automatic workpiece coordinate setting for the master axis at the start
                 of synchronous control.

       #5      SMIx In synchronous control, the manual handle interruption amount for the master axis or the
                    mirror image mode is:
                    0: Reflected in the slave axis.
                    1: Not reflected in the slave axis.

                     Manual handle interruption :
                         To the travel distance along the slave axis, the interruption amount of the master axis
                         is also added.
                     Mirror image :
                         When mirror image is applied to the master axis, mirror image is also applied to the
                         slave axis.

                     When this bit (SMIx) is set to 1
                     Manual handle interruption :
                         To the travel distance along the slave axis, the interruption amount of the master axis
                         is not added.
                     Mirror image :
                         Even when mirror image is applied to the master axis, mirror image is not applied to
                         the slave axis.

                   1: Only       the      path       that      includes   an       axis      related  to
                      synchronization/composite/superposition control is set to the feed hold state.
                      For example, in synchronization control within the same path, the path in which an
                      alarm occurred is set to the feed hold state.

                   •  The emergency stop signal is turned off.
                   •  The servo-off signal is turned on.
                   •  A servo alarm is issued.

                     0:     The synchronous or composite control mode is canceled and follow-up operation is
                            not performed.
                            For the operation to be performed when the servo-off signal is turned on, however,
                            the setting of bit 7 (NSR) of parameter No. 8161 is used in synchronous control or
                            the setting of bit 0 (NMR) of parameter No. 8161 is used in composite control.
                     1:     The synchronous or composite control mode is not canceled. The following
                            operation is performed to perform follow-up operation:
                            When the emergency stop signal is turned off, if the other path is involved, the path
                            operates so that the emergency stop signal is virtually turned off.
                            When the servo-off signal is turned on, the relevant axis is determined and operation
                            is performed so that the servo-off signal is virtually turned on for the determined
                            axis.
                            When a servo alarm is issued, the relevant axis is determined and the alarm SV0003,
                            “CONTINUATION OF SYNCHRONOUS OR COMPOSITE CONTROL
                            DISABLED” is issued for the determined axis to stop moving the tool along the axis.
                            When bit 2 (SVF) of parameter No. 8168 is set to 1, this servo-off specification
                            follows the SVF setting.

                          NOTE
                            This setting is valid also during operation. For all axes placed under
                            synchronous or composite control, the emergency stop signal is
                            turned off, the servo-off signal is turned on, or a servo alarm is
                            issued.

        #2     SVF When an axis under composite control is placed in the servo-off state:
                   0: Composite control is canceled.
                   1: Composite control is not canceled.

                     Follow-up specification follows the setting of bit 0 (FUPx) of parameter No. 1819.
                     When bit 2 (SVF) of parameter No. 8168 is set to 1, bit 0 (NMR) of parameter No. 8161
                     is invalid. Bit 1 (MSO) of parameter No. 8168, specification for servo-off, is also invalid.

                      This parameter sets the path number and intra-path relative axis number of the master axis
                      with which each axis is synchronized. When zero is specified, the axis does not become a
                      slave axis and is not synchronized with another axis. When an identical number is
                      specified in two or more parameters, one master axis has two or more slave axes.

                      When the synchronization deviation detected (bit 1 (SERx) of parameter No.8162 is set to
                      1), this parameter specifies the limit of the difference between the positioning deviation
                      of the slave axis and that of the master axis. Set this parameter to the slave axis.

                   This parameter sets with which axis each axis is to be placed under composite control.
                   When zero is specified, control of the axis is not replaced under composite control. An
                   identical number can be specified in two or more parameters, but composite control
                   cannot be exercised for all of them at a time.

                          When using the conventional 2-path interface (bit 1 (MIX) of
                          parameter No. 8166 is 1, set this parameter on path 2. In this
                          case, use the composite control axis selection signal on path 1.

                   This parameter sets the path number and intra-path relative axis number of a
                   superimposed master axis for each axis when superimposed control is exercised. When
                   zero is specified, the axis does not become a slave axis under superimposed control and
                   the move pulse of another axis is not superimposed.
                   An identical number can be specified in two or more parameters to exercise superimposed
                   control simultaneously. This means that superimposed control with one master axis and
                   multiple slave axes is possible.
                   A slave axis may function as the master axis of another axis to allow three-generation
                   superimposed control: parent (master axis) - child (slave axis/master axis) - grandchild
                   (slave axis).

                     In this case, a movement along the child is made by its travel distance plus the travel
                     distance of the parent, and a movement along the grandchild is made by its travel distance
                     plus the travel distance of the child plus the travel distance of the parent.

                     Example of the relationship of parent (X1 of path 1) - child (X2 of path 2) - grandchild
                     (U2 of path 2):
                     The travel distance of X1 is superimposed on X2, and the travel distances of X1 and X2
                     are further superimposed on U2.

       #0      SSAx When the one-direction synchronization establishment function under axis synchronous
                    control is used:
                    0: The axis with a larger machine coordinate is used as the reference.
                    1: The axis with a smaller machine coordinate is used as the reference.

                        NOTE
                        1 When at least one of these parameters is set, the power must be
                          turned off before operation is continued.
                        2 Set this parameter (SSA) to the same value for both the master
                          and slave axes.

      #2       ADJx In axis synchronous control, this parameter specifies an axis along which a movement is
                    made in the modification mode.
                    0: A movement is not made in the modification mode along the axis.
                    1: A movement is made in the modification mode along the axis.
                    When this parameter is set to 1, the modification mode is set.
                    Along an axis with this parameter set to 1, a movement is made by a move command for
                    the master axis.
                    Set this parameter for one of the master and slave axes.
                    When there are multiple slave axes for one master axis, set this parameter to 1 for an axis
                    with which a synchronization error excessive alarm is issued for recovery. If an alarm is
                    issued with multiple axes, modify this parameter after recovery of one axis to recover
                    another axis.

     #4     MVBx In the modification mode, a move command in a direction that increases a
                 synchronization error is:
                 0: Ignored.
                 1: Valid.
                 When there are multiple slave axes for one master axis, an attempt to reduce the
                 synchronous error of a slave axis by a movement along the master axis can increase the
                 synchronization error of another slave axis. If this parameter is set to 0 in such a case, a
                 movement can be made in neither direction along the master axis. In this case, set bit 2
                 (ADJ) of parameter No. 8304 to make a movement along a slave axis to perform a
                 corrective operation.

      #5    SCAx In axis synchronous control:
                 0: Synchronous operation is performed when the axis synchronous control manual feed
                       selection signal SYNCJ or the axis synchronous control selection signal SYNC for
                       slave axes is set to 1.
                 1: Synchronous operation is performed at all times.
                 Set this parameter with a slave axis.

      #7       SYEx When external machine coordinate system shift is specified by external data input/output
                    for the master axis in synchronous control, the slave axis is:
                    0: Not shifted.
                    1: Shifted by the same amount as specified for the master axis.
                    Set this parameter for the slave axis.
                    This function is disabled during normal operation.

                      (When the increment system is IS-B, 0.0 to +999999.999)
                      This parameter sets a maximum allowable error in a synchronization error check based on
                      machine coordinates. When the error between the master and slave axes in machine
                      coordinates exceeds the value set in this parameter, the machine stops with the servo
                      alarm (SV0005).

                      This parameter sets the maximum allowable difference between the master axis and slave
                      axis position deviations. When the absolute value of a positional deviation difference
                      exceeds the value set in this parameter in axis synchronous control, the alarm (DS0001) is
                      issued.

                      This parameter sets the maximum compensation value for synchronization. When a
                      compensation value exceeding the value set in this parameter is detected, the servo alarm
                      (SV0001) is issued, and the synchronization establishment is not performed.

                      (bit 7 of parameter No.8303) to 1. When 0 is set in this parameter, synchronization
                      establishment is not performed.

                   This parameter sets the program number, including a sequence number, subject to
                   sequence number comparison and stop. Parameter No.8342 is used to set a sequence
                   number subject to check termination.

                   This parameter sets the sequence number subject to sequence number comparison and
                   stop.
                   If the block containing the sequence number set with this parameter is executed while the
                   program set with parameter No.8341 is being executed, a single block stop occurs after
                   the block is executed. At this time, the setting is automatically set to -1.

                     NOTE
                     1 When -1 is set in parameter No. 8342, comparison and stop is
                       disabled.
                     2 Comparison and stop cannot be performed using a sequence
                       number contained in a block (such as a macro statement, M98, and
                       M99) that is processed only inside the CNC.
                     3 When a match is found with the sequence number of a block (such
                       as an L specification of a canned cycle) that specifies the number
                       of repeats, operation stops after executing as many times as the
                       number of repeats.
                     4 If the sequence number set in parameter No. 8342 appears more
                       than once in the program, operation stops at the block where the
                       first match is found in the order of execution.

                   Specify the top number of M code for turning “1” each axis workpiece coordinate system
                   preset signal (Gn358) during automatic operation.
                   When the specified M codes are within the range specified with this parameter and
                   parameter No.11276, each axis workpiece coordinate system preset signal is checked and
                   preset workpiece coordinate system for axis that the signal is turned “1”.
                   The specified M codes prevent buffering.

                    NOTE
                      When each axis workpiece coordinate system preset signals are
                      turned “1” more than two signals by an M code, please turn “1” the
                      signals of all axis at the same timing. If the timing is different, only
                      the axis of the first signal turned “1” is preset.
                      If you want to turn “1” the signals at the different timing, please
                      specify M code separately.

                    used.

                  As mentioned in the description of bit 3 (TPA) of parameter No. 3119, when TPA is set
                  to 0, the baud rate is always set to 19200 bps.

                   attached at the spindle position is started. When the type for counting the number of use
                   times is selected, the target of life counting is switched to the tool attached at the spindle
                   position, and the life count is incremented by 1.
                   When the type for counting time is selected, the target of life counting is switched to the
                   tool attached at the spindle position but no other operations are performed. If the tool
                   attached at the spindle position is not a tool under tool life management, no operation is

                   the tool attached at the spindle position.
                   When 0 is set, an ordinary used code such as H99/D99 is used. When a value other than 0
                   is set, H99/D99 no longer has a particular meaning. So, when H99/D99 is specified in this
                   case, the specification of offset number 99 is assumed.
                   With the T series, address D only is used to specify a tool number and offset number, so
                   that a restriction is imposed on the number of digits. So, the valid data range of this
                   parameter varies according the number of digits of an offset number.
                   When the number of digits of an offset number is 1: to 9

                    NOTE
                      When at least one of these parameters is set, the power must be
                      turned off before operation is continued.

    #2      IRFx An inch-metric switch command (G20, G21) at the reference position is:
                 0: Disabled.
                 1: Enabled.

                  When this function is enabled for an axis, if an attempt to switch between the inch and
                  metric unit is made although the tool is not at the reference position on that axis, an alarm
                  (PS5362) is issued, and switching between the inch and metric unit is canceled.
                  Be sure to move the tool to the reference position by, for example, specifying G28 before
                  switching between the inch and metric unit.

                    NOTE
                    1 This function enables the inch/metric switching commands (G20
                      and G21) at the reference position. It does not enable the
                      switching of the setting input unit (bit 2 (INI) of parameter No.
                      0000).
                    2 Swithching between inch and metric by setting the setting input unit
                      (bit 2 (INI) of parameter No. 0000) is enabled only when the
                      machine coordinate of the first reference position is 0 (parameter
                      No. 1240 is 0) and presence on the first reference position is
                      assumed.
                      For a system in which the machine coordinate of the first reference
                      position is not 0, set this parameter to 1 and specify G20/G21 in the
                      first reference position to switch between inch and metric.

   #7    IMAx When switching between inch and millimeter was performed in a position other than the
              reference position:
              0: An alarm occurs.
              1: No alarm occurs.

                       NOTE
                         Set this parameter to 1 for the rotation axis or other axes not

       [Data type]   2-word axis
    [Unit of data]   Detection unit
[Valid data range]   0 to 99999999
                     This parameter sets the maximum allowable travel distance at the FL feedrate when the
                     reference position is established for a linear scale with an absolute address reference
                     position. When the travel distance exceeds the setting of this parameter, the alarm
                     (DS0017) (SCALE WITH REFERENCE POSITION: REFERENCE POSITION
                     ESTABLISHMENT FAILED) is issued. When this parameter is set to 0, the maximum
                     allowable travel distance is not checked.

                       NOTE
                         When these parameters are set, the power must be turned off before
                         operation is continued.

       [Data type] Byte
[Valid data range] 0 to 7,64,-56,-96
                   Each of these parameters sets the value (ATR value) of the address translation table
                   corresponding to each of slave 1 to slave 18 on FSSB.
                   The slave is a generic term for servo amplifiers and separate detector interface units
                   connected via an FSSB optical cable to the CNC. Numbers 1 to 18 are assigned to slaves,
                   with younger numbers sequentially assigned to slaves closer to the CNC.
                   A 2-axis amplifier consists of two slaves, and a 3-axis amplifier consists of three slaves.
                   In each of these parameters, set a value as described below, depending on whether the
                   slave is an amplifier, separate detector, or nonexistent.
                   •     When the slave is an amplifier:
                         Set a value obtained by subtracting 1 from the setting of parameter No. 1023 for the
                         axis to which the amplifier is assigned.
                   •     When the slave is a separate detector interface unit:
                         Set 64 for the first separate detector interface unit (connected near the CNC), and set
                         -56 for the second separate detector interface unit (connected far from the CNC).
                   •     When the slave is nonexistent:
                         Set -96.

             NOTE
             1 When the electric gear box (EGB) function is used
               Although an amplifier is not actually required for an EGB dummy
               axis, set this parameter with assuming that a dummy amplifier is
               connected. That is, as the address conversion table value for a
               nonexistent slave, set the value obtained by subtracting 1 from the
               setting of parameter No. 1023 for the EGB dummy axis, instead of
               -96.
             2 When the FSSB is set to the automatic setting mode (when the
               parameter FMD (No.1902#0) is set to 0), parameter Nos. 14340 to
               14357 are automatically set as data is input on the FSSB setting
               screen. When the manual setting 2 mode is set (when the
               parameter FMD (No.1902#0) is set to 1), be sure to directly set
               values in parameter Nos. 14340 to 14357.

                      This parameter sets a tolerance value for a program created using miniature line segments
                      in Nano smoothing.

                      When 0 is set in this parameter, a minimum amount of travel in the increment system is

                   assumed. When a value greater than 8 is set, the specification of 8 is assumed. As a
                   greater number of blocks are read, an overcutting (interference) forecast can be made with
                   a command farther ahead. However, the number of blocks read and analyzed increases, so

                       <Hypothetical axis>
                       In some cases, it is convenient to use an imaginary rotary axis
                       whose angle is fixed to a certain value. For example, suppose that
                       a tool is mounted in a tilted manner through an attachment. In such
                       a case, the rotary axis considered hypothetically is a hypothetical
                       axis. Bits 0 (IA1) and 1 (IA2) of parameter No. 19696 determine
                       whether each rotary axis is an ordinary rotary axis or a hypothetical
                       axis.

                     This item specifies the execution cycle for 1st level of ladder.

                         Setting                                             Meaning
                           0, 8        1st level of ladder is executed in 8ms cycle.
                                       In this case, the 2nd level of a ladder is started in multiple of 8ms cycle.
                            4          1st level of ladder is executed in 4ms cycle.
                                       In this case, the 2nd level of a ladder is started in multiple of 4ms cycle.


                          CAUTION
                       1 Setting this parameter to a value other than "0", "4", or "8" results in
                         the PMC alarm "ER55 LEVEL1 EXECUTION CYCLE ERROR", and
                         all PMCs are not executed.
                       2 When this parameter is set "4", the execution frequency of 1st level
                         of ladder becomes double compared with the setting "0" or "8". As a
                         result, the scan time of 2nd level of ladder may increase in some
                         case because execution time for 2nd level decrease.

                       NOTE
                         This parameter is effective when the 0i-D package 1. When the 0i-D
                         package 2 and 0iMate-D, please be sure to set "0" to this
                         parameter. If you set other than "0" to this parameter, a preset value
                         is ignored and a ladder execution cycle is always set to 8ms now,
                         but it is not guaranteed over the future.
